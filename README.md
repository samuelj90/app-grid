# App Grid: Web-Native Application Platform

## Overview

App Grid is a web-based platform for developers to create, publish, and run browser-native applicationsâ€”similar to the Android + Play Store model, but entirely browser-based. Apps are hosted and served under a unified domain, and users can browse, purchase, and run them instantly (no local install required).

**Key Features:**
- Developer publishing and management tools
- App Store for discovery, reviews, and payments
- Secure, isolated app hosting (PaaS)
- Multi-language runtime support (JS, Python, etc.)
- Usage metering and developer payouts

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
pnpm dlx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
pnpm dlx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
